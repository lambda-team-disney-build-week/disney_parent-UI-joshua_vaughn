     <h2>Eric Fugleberg</h2> 
<p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. So often we avoid running water, and running water
     is a lot of fun. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Be brave. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice 
     brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Get away from 
     those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.</p>
       </div>
<div data-tab="2" class="card">
<h2>Hugo Martinez</h2>
<p>Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Let your heart be your guide. Just pretend you are a 
    whisper floating across a mountain. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having
     a snow-covered dinner. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. I like to beat the brush. Just let
 go - and fall like a little waterfall. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. You can do 
 anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.</p>
</div>
<div data-tab="3" class="card">
<h2>Joshua Vaughn</h2>
<p>Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe
    he fell into the river and drowned. You have to make these big decisions. Let's get wild today. Use absolutely 
    no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. With something
     so strong, a little bit can go a long way. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.</p>
</div>
<div data-tab="4" class="card">
<h2>Alan Perez</h2>
<p>Here's another little happy bush Now then, let's play. Here's something that's fun. Let's have a nice tree right
here. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. See there how easy that is. You can bend rivers. But when
 I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Sometimes you 
 learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.</p>
</div>
<div data-tab="5" class="card">
<h2>Kayla Dugas</h2>
<p>We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Let the paint work. Steve wants 
    reflections, so let's give him reflections. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. See. We take the
     corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?</p>
</div>
<div data-tab="6" class="card">
<h2>Troy Bradley</h2>
<p>If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. It just happens - whether or not you
     worried about it or tried to plan it. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?
 Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. We don't have anything but happy trees here.
  I spend a lot of time walking</p>
